GDP Analysis
This repository contains a Python script designed to extract and analyze GDP data from Wikipedia. The script fetches GDP data for various countries, cleans and processes it, performs basic analysis, and visualizes the results.

📊 Project Overview
This project utilizes data from the Wikipedia page "List of countries by GDP (nominal)" to extract GDP estimates, along with their sources (IMF, World Bank, United Nations), and the years of the estimates. The script processes the data to:

Convert GDP values from millions to billions of USD.

Perform basic statistical analysis.

Identify the top 10 countries by GDP.

Generate a bar chart for visual comparison.

🔗 Data Source
GDP data is extracted from the Wikipedia page:
